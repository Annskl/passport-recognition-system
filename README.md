##  Overview
Automated system for Russian passport recognition and data extraction using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Developed as a Bachelor's thesis project.

## Features

- Automatically detects and crops Russian passport pages from scans or photos  
- Extracts key fields: full name, date of birth, place of birth, issue date, authority code, issuing authority  
- Crops and saves the passport holderâ€™s photo  
- Corrects orientation and perspective distortions of the document  
- Recognizes text using a hybrid OCR approach (Tesseract + EasyOCR) with post-processing and fallback  
- Supports batch processing with a graphical interface (progress bar and detailed view)  
- Validates and auto-corrects recognized data to reduce errors  
- **Exports results** to multiple formats: Excel (`.xlsx`), CSV, JSON, and SQLite  
- Works fully offline on Windows


##  Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning:** YOLOv8, PyTorch
- **OCR:** Tesseract, EasyOCR (with custom fine-tuning)
- **Data Annotation:** Roboflow
- **GUI:** PyQt5
- **Language:** Python 3.11
